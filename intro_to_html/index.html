<h1>Taco Bell is the best fast food restaurant!</h1>

<hr>

<h2>Benefits from Working There:</h2>
<p>Working at Taco Bell is an excellent option for parents and students that are not able to work a traditional nine-to-five job. Taco Bell employees receive compensation for up to nine paid holidays per year, along with an additional floating holiday. Taco Bell provides medical, vision, and dental benefits, and these benefits begin on the first day of employment. The Taco Bell Guild program provides students with tuition discounts and reimbursement, allowing workers to pursue higher education without taking on excessive debt.</p>

<h3>New Foods released recently</h3>

<p>The new Luxe Value Menu features the Mini Taco Salad, Beefy Potato Loaded Griller, Chips & Nacho Supreme Dip, Avocado Ranch Chicken Stacker, and Salted Caramel Churros. Additionally, five of the original Cravings Value Menus will transfer to the new Luxe Value Menu, including the Cheesy Roll Up, Spicy Potato Soft Taco, Cheesy Bean and Rice Burrito, 3 Cheese Chicken Flatbread Melt, and Cheesy Double Beef Burrito.</p>

<p>The Avocado Ranch Chicken Stacker has been renamed from the Chipotle Ranch Chicken Stacker, and now features grilled chicken, Avocado Ranch Sauce, cheese, lettuce, and tomatoes in a folded, grilled tortilla instead of using both Avocado Ranch Sauce and creamy chipotle. Otherwise, everything is the same.</p>
